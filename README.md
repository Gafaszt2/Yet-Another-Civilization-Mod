# Yet-Another-Civilization-Mod
More Civilizations for Unciv! such as Belgium, Tanzania, Rhodesia, Habsburg Empire... etc... (more to come)

Hello, it is me again, this time i will add new civiilizations to the game, the exploit test is do it by me on the spectator mode, so dont worry, its pretty balanced!
I used a custom map not done by me for making an edit to contain the true starting locations of the civs of this mod, here we go credits to the original creator:
### [TLS Earth - Oobanooba](https://github.com/Caballero-Arepa/Community-Maps/blob/main/maps/TSL-Earth-XXXL-RR)

The biggest map of Earth so far, combining some other maps into it. By far the most realistic and absolutly huge. Comes with the original version with the mod of BNW, Ancient, Medieval, Latin American civs. **Size: 160x80** So it's under your resposibility loading this gigantic map
